# mnist dataset feed forward network

this is my first project after 1 week of learning and understanding how NNs work

to use it go to console

1 $ pip install tensorflow
2 $ pip install opencv-python

then run file MNISTmodel.py

after that go to the use.py file and change the path in line 15 in ' ' to your path with png or jpg file 
28x28 pixels of a number from 0 to 9

then run use.py
